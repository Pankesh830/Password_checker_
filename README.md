# Password Checker Program in Python by Pankesh Kumar Makwana

This is a simple Python program that can be used to check the strength of passwords. The program prompts the user to enter a password and then evaluates its strength based on a set of criteria.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the Python file `password_checker.py` and follow the prompts. The program will ask you to enter a password and then provide feedback on its strength.

## Criteria

The program evaluates the strength of a password based on the following criteria:

- Length: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long.
- Complexity: A strong password should contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Feedback

Based on the criteria above, the program will provide feedback on the strength of the password. If the password meets all of the criteria, it will be considered strong. If the password fails to meet one or more of the criteria, the program will provide feedback on what needs to be improved.
